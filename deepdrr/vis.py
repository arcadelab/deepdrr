"""Visualization functions for DeepDRR.

DeepDRR uses pyvista to visualize the volumes and devices in 3D.
This is useful for debugging and verification purposes, but it
is not meant to replace a purpose built renderer. To view a scene
in detail, save the meshes to disk and open them in a suitable
viewer, such as 3D Slicer.

Note that these visualizations have the same limitations as PyVista.
They may not function properly in Jupyter notebooks.

Any object with the `get_mesh_in_world()` method can be visualized.
